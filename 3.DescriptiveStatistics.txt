Title:
Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for a
dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative (categorical)
variable.

Objective:
1. If your categorical variable is age groups and quantitative variable is income, then
provide summary statistics of income grouped bythe age groups.
2. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical variable.
3. Display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, standard deviation etc. of the
species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris- versicolor’ of iris.csv dataset.

Theory:
What is Statistics?
 Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and
visualizing empirical data.
 Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are the two major areas of statistics.
 Descriptive statistics are for describing the properties of sample and population data (what
has happened).
 Inferential statistics use those properties to test hypotheses, reach conclusions, and make
predictions (what can you expect).


Mean
 The arithmetic mean of a given data is the sum of all observations divided by the number of
observations.

 For example, a cricketer's scores in five ODI matches are as follows: 12, 34, 45, 50, 24. To
find his average score in a match, we calculate the arithmetic mean of data using the mean
formula:

 Mean = Sum of all observations/Number of observations
Mean = (12 + 34 + 45 + 50 + 24)/5
Mean = 165/5 = 33
Mean is denoted by x̄ (pronounced as x bar).


Mode
 The Mode refers to the most frequently occurring value in your data.
 You find the frequency of occurrence of each number and the number with the highest
frequency is your mode. If there are no recurring numbers, then there is no mode in the data.
 Using the mode, you can find the most commonly occurring point in your data. This is
helpful when you have to find the central tendency of categorical values, like the flavor of
the most popular chip sold by a brand. You cannot find the average based on the orders;
instead, you choose the chip flavor with the highest orders.
 Usually, you can count the most frequently occurring values and get your mean. But this
only works when the values are discrete.


Median
 Median refers to the middle value of a data. To find the median, you first sort the data in
either ascending or descending order or then find the numerical value present in the middle
of your data.
 It can be used to figure out the point around which the data is centered. It divides the data
into two halves and has the same number of data points above and below.
 The median is especially useful when the data is skewed data. That is, it has high data
distribution towards one side. In this case, the average wouldn't give you a fair mid-value
but would lean more towards the higher values. In this case, you can use the middle data
point as the central point instead.

Standard Deviation and Variance
 Deviation just means how far from the normal
 The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
 Its symbol is σ (the greek letter sigma)

 The formula is easy: it is the square root of the Variance.



groupby()
A groupby operation involves some combination of splitting the object, applying a function, and
combining the results. This can be used to group large amounts of data and compute operations
on these groups.
