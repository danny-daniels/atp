Title: Data Visualization III
Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame. (e.g.,
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ). Scan the dataset and give the inference as:
1. List down the features and their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) available in the
dataset. 2. Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature
distributions. 3. Create a box plot for each feature in the dataset.
4. Compare distributions and identify outliers.

Objective of the Assignment: Students should be able to perform the data Visualization
operation using Python on any open source dataset .








#Import required libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

#Create the data frame for downloaded iris.csv dataset:
df=pd.read_csv('iris.csv')

df.head()

df.tail()

df.isnull().sum()

#List down the features and their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) available in the dataset:

print("\n\nThe features in the dataset are as follows : ")
print("1. Sepal length : ", df['sepal_length'].dtype)
print("2. Sepal width : ", df['sepal_width'].dtype)
print("3. Petal length : ", df['petal_length'].dtype)
print("4. Petal width : ", df['petal_width'].dtype)
print("5. Species : ", df['species'].dtype)

#Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset:

sns.boxplot(df['sepal_length'])

sns.boxplot(df['sepal_width'])

sns.boxplot(df['petal_length'])

sns.boxplot(df['petal_width'])

#Compare distributions and identify outliers:
sns.boxplot(df['sepal_length'], df['species'])

sns.boxplot(df['petal_length'], df['species'])


Theory:
Boxplot:A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that
facilitates comparisons between variables or across levels of a categorical variable. The box shows the
quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution, except for points
that are determined to be “outliers” using a method that is a function of the inter-quartile range.

Histograms:
A histogram is basically used to represent data provided in a form of some groups.It is accurate method
for the graphical representation of numerical data distribution. It is a type of bar plot where X-axis
represents the bin ranges while Y-axis gives information about frequency.
